# A personal website built using TailwindCSS

So this is [my personal website](https://whomwah.com). It's very simple. It's build with Vite [https://docs.deno.com/deploy/tutorials/vite/] and is deployed via Deno Deploy [https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual/]. The animation uses [tsParticles](https://particles.js.org/).

You can run `just` to find out what commands are available.
